#  Tower Defense Simulator Statistics Editor
A forked version that aims to keep the editor up to date. It includes many quality of life changes that are mostly from the fact that it has support for the TDS Wiki. (Hopefully in the future lolol.)

You are free to contribute if you wish to (sorry for the spaghetti code, by the way).
