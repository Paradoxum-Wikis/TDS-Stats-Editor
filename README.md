#  Tower Defense Simulator Statistics Editor
A forked version that aims to keep the editor up to date. It includes many quality of life changes that are mostly from the fact that it has support for the TDS Wiki. (Hopefully in the future lolol.)

You are free to contribute if you wish to (sorry for the spaghetti code, by the way).

# FAQ
## Will there be new features?
Yes, there are a few on the backburner, bug fixes have the highest priority.

## How long will it be supported?
I can make no guarantees that it'd be forever updated, although I do expect it to be around for quite a while. Even if it were to shut down, due to the nature of it being open source, anyone can contribute directly to it or make forks of the site. (Like what I did, duhuhu.)

## I want to suggest something, how should I contact you?
Direct messages on Discord are preferred (my user is t7ru), though there are multiple ways you can contact me and any of them are fine.

There are also discussions and updates about this editor on #general's thread of the Tower Defense Simulator Wiki [server](https://discord.com/invite/eSKUNqJ). Unfortunately, you will need a FANDOM account to access it, so make one if you're interested.

## Is this official?
Absolutely not, this editor is in no way officially affiliated with Paradoxum Games, and therefore, Tower Defense Simulator.
