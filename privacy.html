      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> May 25, 2025</p>
      <p>
        This page explains what information is collected when you use the TDS
        Statistics Editor, how it is used, and your choices regarding data
        collection.
      </p>

      <h2>Geographic Detection for Consent</h2>
      <p>
        To comply with privacy regulations in different regions, we detect your
        approximate location (country-level) using third-party IP geolocation
        services. This detection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only determines your country to decide if consent is required</li>
        <li>Does not store or track your location data</li>
        <li>Is performed once per visit for consent determination only</li>
        <li>
          Uses services like ipapi.co which have their own privacy policies
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Based on your location, analytics may be automatically enabled (for
        regions without strict privacy laws) or require your explicit consent
        (EU, UK, EEA, Switzerland, Turkey).
      </p>

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics with Consent Mode to collect anonymous usage
        data. Data collection depends on your consent status:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>With consent:</strong> Full analytics data is collected (see
          below)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Without consent:</strong> Only anonymous pings for modeling
          (no personal data)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>When you consent, we collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pages visited and time spent on each page</li>
        <li>
          Browser and device information (e.g., operating system, screen size)
        </li>
        <li>Referring website (if any)</li>
        <li>General geographic region (city/country, not precise location)</li>
        <li>Events triggered by your actions within the site (see below)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Event Tracking</h2>
      <p>
        When analytics is enabled, we track the following anonymous events to
        understand how the site is used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Tower Selection:</strong> When you select a tower, the tower's
          name is logged as an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Calculation System Change:</strong> When you change the
          calculation system, the selected system is logged as an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tower Search:</strong> When you search for a tower, your
          search query is logged as an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Copy Actions:</strong> When you copy data (JSON, Wikitable, or
          Lua), the type of data copied is logged as an event.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Export Actions:</strong> When you export data (JSON,
          Wikitable, or Lua), the type of data exported is logged as an event.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em
          >No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected or stored.
          All event data is anonymous and used solely for improving the
          site.</em
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Consent and Control</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may be asked for consent before
        analytics data is collected, or analytics may be automatically enabled.
        You can always change your consent at any time in the site settings.
        Your choice is stored locally in your browser and respected across
        visits.
      </p>

      <h2>Google Analytics Consent Mode</h2>
      <p>
        We use Google Analytics Consent Mode, which adjusts data collection
        based on your consent choices. This ensures compliance with privacy
        regulations while still allowing for some anonymous measurement to
        improve our services.
      </p>

      <h2>Cookies and Local Storage</h2>
      <p>We use:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> Google Analytics cookies (only
          with consent)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent storage:</strong> Your consent choice is stored in
          browser's localStorage
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Settings storage:</strong> Your preferences are also stored in
          your browser's localStorage
        </li>
      </ul>
